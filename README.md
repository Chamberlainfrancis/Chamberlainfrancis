### Chamberlain Francis

TECH STACK: JavaScript | HTML | CSS | SCSS | Reactjs | Next.js | MySQL | PHP | Working hard to master Nodejs

I am a developer who loves to build software that solves problems and has an impact on its users. 

I focus more of my energy on front-end software engineering and development because I love beauty and care about user experience.

I am enthusiastic, outgoing, and ready to work. I'm the guy if you need someone to help build your product.
